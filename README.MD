## MENTALPY
MENTALPY is a terminal app of questions a therapists may ask you. User simply enters the text and it will be asked a randomized question. This does not have machine learning implented.

## WHY?
My research shows that therapy and mental-health related services are so expensive and it not only takes a lot of time to find the right therapist, but if you're lucky to find one they might just ask you generic questions.

# GOAL
A bit of self-therapy to rewire your brain may be benificial to be a good citizen and not ruin the atual therapists job, and others you encounter in your network and in every day life. I'm not mad, you're mad ;)

## PRIVACY
In today's world, those who know know, that by looking into that app you're being monitored and being harvested (likewise the therapist). We do strongly suggest reaching out to professionals (I mean real professionals) or a friend or use an existing app if it's an emergency.

Privacy barely exists these days. That's ok for some, but some users would rather have Privacy and then go on with their day and feel comfortable. It's as simple as meditation or walking meditation, but professionals still exist for a reason.
